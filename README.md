# Sleep Stability Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis code for a research project evaluating sleep stability in insomnia. The study investigates how sleep stability, or rather its instability, can be explained by infraslow fluctuations in sigma power, a proxy measure of LC activity during NREM sleep.
